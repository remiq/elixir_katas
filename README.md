#Elixir Katas

I'll be collecting some interesting Katas that I find around the web and 
compile them into this repository in order to fast forward you to the
coding on Elixir itself.

If you're having trouble or don't feel like installing the whole Elixir
shizzle in your harddrive feel free to use my [docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/trenpixster/elixir/) to give it a spin.

## But why?
I think it's a great way to dive into a new programming language. And
since "sharing is caring", here it is for you!

## How?
In each directory there is a test file which will check if your Kata executes correctly.

To check if the tests pass:
```
you@elixir_katas $ cd kata1
you@kata1 $ mix test
```

The `master` branch will only have the kata exercises.
The `solutions` branch will have the solutions so you can check them in case you ever feel lost.

Please feel free to contribute by submitting your solutions!
