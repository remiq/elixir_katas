#Katas

## But why?
I think it's a great way to dive into a new programming language.

## How?
In each directory there is a test file which will check if your Kata executes correctly.

To check if the tests pass:
```
you@elixir_katas $ cd kata1
you@kata1 $ mix test
```

The `master` branch will only have the kata exercises.
The `solutions` branch will have the solutions so you can check them in case you ever feel lost.
